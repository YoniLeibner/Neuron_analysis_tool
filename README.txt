this project helps the analysis on neuron to equivelant cables/ dendorgams and voltage decays
the package have 2 main part:

peeler - a gui on matplotlib to help peel expinantinal decays from short pulse (see Rall ref), a word document will be attached shortly
analyzer - this tool can help you anlyze your neuron!!!! it have:
            morphology plot - where you can color code each segment
            morphology value plot - where you can give a value for color coding the morphology
            dendogram plot - where you can color code each segment in both physical units and electrical units
            dendogram value plot - where you can give a value for color coding the morphology
            attenuation plot - ploting the attenuation along the tree -> y axis can be normed, and x axis (distance from origin) can be scaled to electrical units
            video creator - create a video on voltage/channel conductances of preset protocol or protocol of your choosing


please look on the 3 jupyter notebook in this repo and for any question contact me on yoni.leibner@mail.huji.ac.il
